# React Poke'Times

My second time with React. App made with the React Tutorials by The Net Ninja - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg

## How to start

After cloning the repo open your terminal and run the following commands

`npm install`
`npm start`

App should automatically start in your browser.
